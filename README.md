# Awesome NINA
Curated list of resources and tools used in NINA

# GIS
## Tools
- [GDAL](https://gdal.org) - GDAL is a translator library for raster and vector geospatial data formats
- [TiPG](https://github.com/developmentseed/tipg) - OGC Features and Tiles from PG database
- [PyGEOAPI](https://docs.pygeoapi.io/en/stable/) -  provides an API to geospatial data.
- [Terracotta](https://github.com/DHI-GRAS/terracotta) - A light-weight, versatile XYZ tile server, built with Flask and Rasterio üåç
- [TiTiler](https://devseed.com/titiler/) is a set of python modules that focus on creating FastAPI application for dynamic tiling.
- [Martin](https://github.com/maplibre/martin) - Blazing fast and lightweight PostGIS, MBtiles and PMtiles tile server, tile generation, and mbtiles tooling.

## Vectors
- [PMTiles](https://docs.protomaps.com/pmtiles/) - PMTiles is a single-file archive format for pyramids of tiled data. A PMTiles archive can be hosted on a storage platform like S3, and enables low-cost, zero-maintenance map applications.

## Raster

### Cloud Optimized GEOTiff
[A Cloud Optimized GeoTIFF (COG)](https://www.cogeo.org/) is a regular GeoTIFF file, aimed at being hosted on a HTTP file server, with an internal organization that enables more efficient workflows on the cloud. It does this by leveraging the ability of clients issuing ‚ÄãHTTP GET range requests to ask for just the parts of a file they need.

- [geotiff.js](https://geotiffjs.github.io/) is a small library to parse TIFF files for visualization or analysis including Cloud Optimized GeoTIFFs. It is written in pure JavaScript, and is usable in both the browser and node.js applications.
- [TiTiler](https://devseed.com/titiler/) is a set of python modules that focus on creating FastAPI application for dynamic tiling.
- [https://github.com/developmentseed/mosaicjson-spec](https://github.com/developmentseed/mosaicjson-spec)
- [https://github.com/GeoTIFF/geotiff-palette](https://github.com/GeoTIFF/geotiff-palette)
- [COGServer](https://github.com/rouault/cogserver) Expose any GDAL recognized raster file as a HTTP accessible on-the-fly COG

# ML

## Data Annotation

- [LabelStudio](https://labelstud.io/): Open source annotation software for all types of data and tasks.

## Object detection

- [Pytorch Wildlife](https://github.com/microsoft/CameraTraps/blob/main/megadetector.md): model weights for detection of wild animals in camera trap pictures.
- [Detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2): Library providing SOTA models for object detection, segmentation algorithms. Maintained by Meta.

## Acoustic 

- [BEATs](https://github.com/microsoft/unilm/tree/master/beats): Model weights for SOTA acoustic classifier. There was a tensor shape error that was fixed [here](https://github.com/NINAnor/rare_species_detections)

## Utils libraries

- [Audiomentation](https://github.com/iver56/audiomentations): Provide lots of utilitary functions for audio data augmentation. Alternative to [torchaudio](https://pytorch.org/audio/stable/index.html).
